# MSVG Tools

**MSVG Tools** is an open-source collection of utilities for working with **MSVG** (Multi-Page-SVG) files â€” a format for combining multiple `<svg>` pages into a single structured document.

---

## ðŸ–¼ What is MSVG?

An **MSVG** file is an XML-based container format that can hold multiple SVG pages in a single file.

### Structure example:
```xml
<MSVG version="1.0">
  <pageSet>
    <Page>
      <!-- SVG page 1 -->
    </Page>
    <Page>
      <!-- SVG page 2 -->
    </Page>
    ...
  </pageSet>
</MSVG>
```

Each `<Page>` typically contains a complete <svg> element, including its own viewBox and style definitions.

The MSVG format is fully transparent â€” itâ€™s just plain text XML. You can open it with any text editor to inspect or edit its contents. Because it doesnâ€™t contain executable code, itâ€™s safe by design and cannot carry malware.

#### MSVG is useful for:

-    Digital books made from multiple vector pages

-    Large diagrams split into pages

-    multi-page documents with vectors and raster layers

## ðŸ“„ MSVG Viewer (Python)

- Sorts them numerically (page1.svg, page2.svg, etc.)
- Strips XML headers
- Wraps each page in `<Page>` tags inside a `<pageSet>` container
